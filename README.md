### OBJECTIVES :Python program for sentiment analysis using the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) and a machine learning classifier. This example uses a simple bag-of-words approach to classify text as either positive or negative.
### This project involves the following steps:



**Data Preparation:**The movie_reviews corpus from NLTK is used, which contains labeled movie reviews.  Reviews are shuffled and split into training and test datasets.
**Feature Extraction:**The extract_features function creates a dictionary of words from the review with True as their value, representing the presence of each word.
**Training the Classifier:**A Naive Bayes classifier is trained using the training dataset. The accuracy of the classifier is evaluated using the test dataset.
**Classifying New Sentences:** New sentences are tokenized and classified using the trained model.
